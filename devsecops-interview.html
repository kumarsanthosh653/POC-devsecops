Cloud Trail:-------------

Every action that you may take in AWS is monitored and with AWS Cloudtrail you can store all these actions,
API calls, and service runs inside an S3 bucket to query them later.

Given a user, what services did the user use in a period?
Given a service, which users integrated with it in a given period?
What IP address did what request to the AWS services?

Dependency Identification:
Vulnerability Detection:
License Compliance:

Key Aspects SAST Tools Check for in Java Projects:
Code Vulnerabilities:
Code Quality Issues:
Security Misconfigurations:

Synk:
✓ Synk is a vulnerability scanner for open source dependencies. You can integrate it into your 
CI/CD pipeline to scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
✓ Configure Synk to run automatically as part of your build process or scheduled scans.
✓ Utilize Synk's APIs or CLI to report vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions based on the 
severity of the findings.

Hadolint:
✓ Hadolint is a linter for Dockerfiles, which helps identify potential issues and best practices 
violations in Dockerfiles.
✓ Integrate Hadolint into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check Dockerfile syntax and 
adherence to best practices.
✓ Configure Hadolint to run as a pre-build step or as part of your Docker image build process.
hadolint --config hadolint.yml Dockerfile 2>&1 | tee log.yml

Kubelinter:
✓ Kubelinter is a linter for Kubernetes YAML files, ensuring adherence to best practices and 
identifying potential issues.
✓ Incorporate Kubelinter into your CI/CD pipeline to validate Kubernetes YAML files before 
deploying to your cluster.
✓ Integrate Kubelinter into your CI workflow to run alongside other tests or as a separate step 
dedicated to Kubernetes manifest validation.
kube-linter lint ndep.yml  2>&1 | tee log.yml

OWASP Testing (DAST):
✓ OWASP provides a set of tools and methodologies for dynamic application security testing 
(DAST) to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
✓ Integrate OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) or similar DAST tools into your pipeline to 
automatically scan your web applications for common security vulnerabilities.
✓ Configure OWASP ZAP to run against your web application at appropriate stages of your 
CI/CD pipeline, such as after deployment to a staging environment.
